    title: "Environmental Monitoring Failure",
    scenario: "The environmental monitoring system in a sterile manufacturing cleanroom (ISO Class 5) failed to record viable particle counts for a 4-hour period during an aseptic filling operation. The failure occurred due to a power outage that affected the monitoring equipment, but backup power systems did not activate as designed. Production continued during this period, and 2,500 vials of injectable product were filled. The environmental monitoring data gap was discovered during the daily review of batch records. No visual contamination was observed, and the filled vials appeared normal, but the sterility assurance cannot be verified for this time period.",
